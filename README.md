# ObsidianPlugin
A Template Repository for building [Obsidian](https://github.com/Naamloos/Obsidian) plugins. Make sure to rename the assemblies to ensure compatibility with other plugins.

## How to use
1. fetch the latest build
2. add it to the ServerFiles directory
3. open the solution

Obsidian.API.dll should now automatically be loaded by visual studio, and debugging with the server _should_ work now.
